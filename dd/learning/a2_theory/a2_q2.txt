Booting a BeagleBone Black (BBB) involves a multi-stage process where each step hands off execution to the next, moving from the hardware-coded logic to the final Linux environment.
________________
1. The Boot Sequence (Multi-Stage)
The AM335x processor on the BBB doesn't load the entire OS at once. It follows a specific chain:
Stage 1: ROM Code
When powered on, the processor executes code hardcoded into its internal ROM. This code is responsible for:
* Checking the boot pins (SYSBOOT) to determine the boot source (eMMC, microSD, USB, or UART).
* Locating the Secondary Program Loader (SPL) from the boot device and loading it into the processor's internal SRAM.
Stage 2: SPL (MLO)
Because the system RAM (DDR3) isn't initialized yet, the ROM code loads a small piece of code called the SPL (often named MLO).
* Role: It initializes the DDR3 RAM and the external memory controller.
* Action: Once the RAM is ready, it loads the full bootloader (U-Boot) into the DDR3 and jumps to it.
Stage 3: U-Boot
U-Boot is the "main" bootloader. It provides an interactive shell and handles the heavy lifting:
* Enables hardware like Ethernet and MMC.
* Searches for the Linux Kernel image (zImage or uImage) and the Device Tree Blob (DTB).
* Passes boot arguments (e.g., where the root filesystem is located) to the kernel.
Stage 4: Linux Kernel & User Space
* Kernel: Initializes drivers, mounts the Root File System (rootfs), and starts the first user-space process.
* Init System: Usually systemd on modern Debian builds, which starts services (SSH, networking, etc.) and provides the login prompt.

2. Monitoring via Serial UART
To see this process in real-time—especially if the board isn't appearing on your network—you must use the UART0 headers on the board.
Hardware Needed
1. USB-to-TTL Serial Cable: (e.g., FTDI cable).
2. Connection: Connect the cable pins to the 6-pin header (J1) near the power jack.
   * Note: Ensure the Ground (GND) and RX/TX pins are aligned correctly. Never connect the 3.3V pin.
Software Utilities
Once the hardware is connected, you need a serial terminal emulator on your PC. Use the following settings:
* Baud Rate: 115200
* Data Bits: 8
* Stop Bits: 1
* Parity: None
* Flow Control: None
Recommended Tools:
* Minicom (Linux/macOS): A classic command-line utility.
   * sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
* Screen (Linux/macOS): Simple and often pre-installed.
   * screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
* PuTTY (Windows/Linux): A versatile GUI-based client. Select "Serial," enter your COM port, and set the speed to 115200.
* Tera Term (Windows): Excellent for logging boot sequences to a file for later debugging.
