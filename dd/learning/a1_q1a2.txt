### 2.1 Requirements

* BeagleBone Black board
* microSD card (8 GB or higher)
* USB cable
* Ubuntu Linux PC
* Internet connection

---

### 2.2 Step 1: Download Linux Image

1. Open terminal in Ubuntu
2. Visit official BeagleBone website
3. Download **Debian Linux image** (`.img.xz` file)

Example:

```bash
wget https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/latest-image.img.xz
```

---

### 2.3 Step 2: Extract the Image

```bash
unxz latest-image.img.xz
```

This creates a `.img` file.

---

### 2.4 Step 3: Insert microSD Card

Check device name:

```bash
lsblk
```

Example device:

```text
/dev/sdb
```

---

### 2.5 Step 4: Flash Image Using dd Command

```bash
sudo dd if=latest-image.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress
sync
```

⚠️ Be careful to select the correct device.

---

### 2.6 Step 5: Boot from microSD Card

1. Power OFF BeagleBone Black
2. Insert microSD card
3. Press and hold **BOOT button**
4. Connect power via USB or DC adapter
5. Release BOOT button after LEDs light up

---

### 2.7 Step 6: Flashing Process

* LEDs blink continuously
* Flashing takes **5–10 minutes**
* Board powers off automatically after completion

---

### 2.8 Step 7: Remove SD Card and Reboot

1. Remove microSD card
2. Power ON BBB
3. Board boots from internal eMMC

---

### 2.9 Step 8: Verify Linux Installation

Connect via USB:

```bash
ssh debian@192.168.7.2
```

(Default password: `temppwd`)

---

### 2.10 LED Indications During Flashing
